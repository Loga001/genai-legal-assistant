Project Title: GenAI-Powered Legal Assistant for SMEs

Project Description:

This project is a GenAI-powered legal assistant designed to help small and medium businesses understand complex legal contracts. 
The system analyzes contracts, extracts clauses, detects risky terms such as indemnity, penalties, and unfair termination clauses, and provides clause-by-clause explanations in simple business language.
The platform assigns an overall risk score, highlights unfavorable clauses, and suggests safer interpretations, enabling SMEs to make better legal decisions without requiring legal expertise. 
The solution simplifies contract understanding and helps reduce legal and financial risks for businesses.
